## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? A system used to track changes in computer files.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? GitHub manages repositories.
3. Why do we create a branch? To make changes without working on main branch.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? to review differences between branches.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. cd Main
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? git fetch downloads content from a remote repository.
git merge puts forked history back together again.
git pull  is used to fetch and download content from remote repository and immediately update to the local repository to match that content.
7. What is a merge conflict? Conflicting changes made to the same file, such as, one person editing a file and another deleting that same file.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? Under repository name click the button pull requests. In pull request click pull request with a merge conflict you would like to resolve. Then click the resolve conflicts button once you have resolved the problem. After that click the mark as resolved button. Click the commit merge button and either update your current branch or create a new branch.
